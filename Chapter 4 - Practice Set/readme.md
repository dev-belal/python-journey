# Chapter 4 - Practice Set

Here I practiced list and tuple manipulation by solving small problems. I worked on adding, removing, sorting elements, and understanding the difference between mutable and immutable sequences.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* List indexing and mutation
* Tuple immutability
* List methods (`pop()`, `reverse()`, `count()`)
* Using loops with lists and tuples

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Practice: Modify list elements
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
numbers[1] = 25
print(numbers)
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
[10, 25, 30]
```
