# Chapter 7 - Loops in Python

In this chapter, I explored how to use **loops** to repeat actions in Python programs. I learned about both `for` and `while` loops, how to control them, and when to use each one effectively.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* `for` loops and iterating over sequences
* `while` loops and loop conditions
* The `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements
* Loop `else` clauses
* Using the `range()` function
* Nested loops

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Example: Using a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
```
