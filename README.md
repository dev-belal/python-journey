# 🐍 Python Journey

Welcome to my *Python Learning Journey* — a collection of notebooks, exercises, and mini-projects documenting my path from beginner to automation-ready Python developer.

## 🚀 What You'll Find

* *Basics Concepts:* Variables, loops, conditionals, data structures
* *Intermediate Concepts:* OOP, file handling, APIs
* *Mini Projects:* Small automation and logic-based tasks

Each notebook is commented and organized to make it easy for others to follow or reuse.
