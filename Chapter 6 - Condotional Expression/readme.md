# Chapter 6 - Conditional Expression

This chapter introduced **conditional statements** that let Python programs make decisions. I learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the program flow based on conditions.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Writing conditional expressions (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Comparison and logical operators
* Nested conditions
* Using shorthand `if` statements
* Importance of indentation in Python

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Example: Conditional expressions
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print("You are not eligible yet.")
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
You are eligible to vote!
```
