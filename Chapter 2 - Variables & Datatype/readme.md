# Chapter 2 - Variables & Datatype

In this chapter, I learned how to store data in variables and understand different data types in Python. I practiced declaring variables, checking their types, and converting between them.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Declaring and naming variables
* Basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* Typecasting and conversions
* Using the `type()` function
* String concatenation and formatting

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Example: Working with variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
print("Type of age:", type(age))
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
Alice is 25 years old.
Type of age: <class 'int'>
```
