# Chapter 5 - Practice Set

In this practice set, I applied what I learned about dictionaries and sets by solving exercises that involve data storage, key lookups, and performing set operations.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Creating and updating dictionaries
* Accessing values safely with `.get()`
* Adding and removing set elements
* Using set operations to find relationships between data

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Practice: Working with sets and dictionaries
info = {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "city": "London"}
info["age"] = 23
print(info)

numbers = {1, 2, 3}
numbers.add(4)
print(numbers)
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 23, 'city': 'London'}
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```
