# Chapter 1 - Modulus, Comments & pip

Welcome to the start of the Python journey! 🎉
In this chapter, I explored the basics of Python syntax — including how to write comments, use operators like modulus, and install packages using **pip**.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Using the modulus operator (`%`)
* Writing single-line (`#`) and multi-line comments
* Installing and managing Python packages with `pip`
* Printing output to the console

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Example: Modulus and comments
num1 = 17
num2 = 5
print("Remainder:", num1 % num2)  # Output: 2
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
Remainder: 2
```
