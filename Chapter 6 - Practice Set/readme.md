# Chapter 6 - Practice Set

This folder contains exercises focused on applying conditional logic to solve real-world problems. I practiced nested `if` statements and wrote short programs with user input.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Using comparison and logical operators in conditions
* Building decision trees with `if-elif-else`
* Implementing nested conditions
* Handling user input with `input()` and type conversion

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Practice: Simple grading program
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A+"
elif marks >= 75:
    grade = "A"
elif marks >= 60:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"

print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
Enter your marks: 85
Your grade is: A
```
