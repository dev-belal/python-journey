# Chapter 4 - List & Tuples

In this chapter, I learned about **lists** and **tuples** — how to store multiple items, access them, and perform basic operations. Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Creating and accessing lists and tuples
* List methods (`append()`, `sort()`, `insert()`, `remove()`)
* Tuple characteristics and immutability
* Slicing lists and tuples
* Iterating through sequences

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Example: Working with lists and tuples
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)

colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[1])
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
green
```
