# Chapter 7 - Practice Set

This practice set includes exercises that strengthen understanding of Python loops. I worked on problems involving nested loops, control statements, and sequence traversal.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Using `for` and `while` loops in real problems
* Applying `break` and `continue`
* Building simple patterns and tables
* Combining loops with conditionals

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Practice: Multiplication table
num = 3
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
...
3 x 10 = 30
```
