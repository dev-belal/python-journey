# Chapter 8 - Practice Set

In this practice set, I implemented small programs using custom functions and recursive logic. I practiced writing reusable, modular code and solving problems step-by-step.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Writing and calling user-defined functions
* Passing parameters and using return statements
* Recursive problem-solving
* Organizing code into functions for readability

## 💻 Example Code

```python
# Practice: Recursive sum of n numbers
def recursive_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + recursive_sum(n - 1)

print("Sum of first 5 numbers:", recursive_sum(5))
```

## 📚 Example Output

```
Sum of first 5 numbers: 15
```
